The **Ask AI** dashboard provides an interactive, chat-style interface where you can directly query Heimdall’s integrated AI assistant. This feature is powered by an active Large Language Model (LLM) and is designed to help you get answers quickly without manually navigating through documentation or reports.

You can use _Ask AI_ to:

* **Learn about Heimdall’s features** – Ask questions such as “What does the Producers dashboard do?” or “How do I configure a new scenario?” and receive clear, documentation-based answers.
* **Get step-by-step guidance** – Ask how to perform specific tasks, and the AI will respond with instructions drawn from the application’s official help content.
* **Locate information** – Request the AI to find details across the system using Heimdall’s search engine, helping you quickly retrieve relevant data, logs, or configuration details.
* **Analyze and interpret results** – Ask the AI to summarize findings or provide insights into retrieved information to assist in troubleshooting or decision-making.

The assistant relies on the application’s documentation and available indexed data, ensuring answers are accurate and relevant to Heimdall. This makes it a valuable companion for both new and experienced users, especially when time is critical or you are unsure where to look.
