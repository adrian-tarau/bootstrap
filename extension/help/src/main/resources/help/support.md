The **Support** section provides a suite of dashboards designed to monitor Heimdall’s own features and overall system health. While Heimdall’s primary role is to observe and test external services, the Support section focuses inward — giving you visibility into the application’s internal state and performance.

It consolidates several key monitoring areas:

* **Logs (Alerts)** – View recorded events, warnings, and errors generated by Heimdall, helping you identify and troubleshoot issues quickly.
* **Metrics** – Track operational indicators such as counters, gauges, and timers that reflect resource usage, performance trends, and processing rates.
* **Tasks** – Monitor scheduled or on-demand tasks, including their execution history, status, and any related errors.
* **Threads** – Inspect thread and thread pools to understand concurrency levels, thread utilization, and potential bottlenecks.
* **System Information** – Review hardware, JVM, and runtime details for the environment where Heimdall is running.
* **Other Diagnostics** – Access additional internal monitoring tools and statistics that assist in performance tuning and root cause analysis.

These dashboards are especially useful for administrators and advanced users who need to ensure Heimdall is functioning optimally, detect internal issues early, and maintain stable monitoring and testing operations.
