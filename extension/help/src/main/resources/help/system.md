The **System** section provides administrative tools and settings that allow you to configure and manage core features of Heimdall. While most dashboards focus on monitoring or testing services, the System section is dedicated to the operational backbone of the application — defining how Heimdall behaves, what features are enabled, and how it interacts with monitored environments and test scenarios.

This section is primarily intended for users with administrative privileges or advanced configuration needs. It enables fine-tuning of the application’s behavior, integration settings, and resource management to align with your organization’s testing and monitoring requirements.

Changes made in this section can affect all users and test environments connected to Heimdall, so updates should be performed with care.
